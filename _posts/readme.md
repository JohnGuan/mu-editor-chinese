Add blog post markdown files here.
They should have a date - yyyy-mm-dd-name.md

These should have "layout: post" in the yml header, and a title. It can be standard markdown below.
Files not conforming to the datetime type, or without the yml header won't show up on the site.

Example yaml header

    ---
    layout: post
    title: My great blog post
    category : lessons
    tagline: "Supporting tagline"
    tags : [my_tag, something_else]
    ---
    my lovely blog post content
